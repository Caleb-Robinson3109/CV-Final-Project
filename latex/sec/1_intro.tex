\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

This paper will go into detail about the final project for CS5404 Intro to Computer Vision. The first goal of the project was to create a KITRO \cite{KITRO_2024} + random forest model for 3D mesh generation. KITRO is a 3D mesh generation model, that will take a HMR (human mesh recovery) and refine it. Resulting in a overall more accurate 3D mesh. We will is to take the pre-KITRO predictions and the post-KITRO predictions combine the two and train a random forest model on the data. We want to see if another model stacked on top of KITRO will result in a more refined 3D mesh. The  second goal of the project is to make it easy to visualize the 3D mesh. There is not a documented way to visualize the 3D mesh generated by KITRO. It involves extra dependence. Visualization of the generated 3d meshes is important for this project because we want to see the work that we put into the mesh refinement. For this reason we will be adding a script that allows for the generation of the 3D mesh into a .png or .gif.

This project was built on top of, and made possible because of the work done on the KITRO model. The KITRO code is aviable at \url{https://github.com/MartaYang/KITRO}!

To view or clone the stacked random forest model or the mesh visualization, the code is available on GitHub: \url{https://github.com/Caleb-Robinson3109/CV-Final-Project} Our contributons can be found in the cs5404 sub directory.
