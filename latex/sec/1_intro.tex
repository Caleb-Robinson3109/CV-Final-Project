\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

This paper will go into detail about the final project for CS5404: Intro to Computer Vision. The first goal of the project was to create a KITRO \cite{KITRO_2024} + Random Forest model for 3D mesh generation. KITRO is a 3D mesh generation model that will take an HMR (human mesh recovery) and refine it. This results in a 3D mesh that is more accurate overall. We will take the pre-KITRO predictions and the post-KITRO predictions, combine the two, and train a Random Forest regression model on the data. We want to see if another model stacked on top of KITRO will result in a more refined 3D mesh. The  second goal of the project is to make it easy to visualize the 3D mesh. There is no documented way to visualize the 3D mesh generated by KITRO, and the actual process requires installing additional dependencies. Visualization of the generated 3D meshes is important for this project because the generated 3D meshes can be visually inspected for errors. For this reason, we add a script that presents the 3D meshes as a set of PNG or GIF images.

This project was built on top of the KITRO model, and our progress was only made possible because of the work already put into it. The code for the original KITRO model is available at \url{https://github.com/MartaYang/KITRO}.
