The output of the combined Random Forest regression + KITRO model was sigificantly inaccurate in comparison to KITRO on its own. This was confirmed not only through inspecting the visualized 3D meshes, but also through the R squared scores, which are measures of the similarity of the predicted data to the actual data. 

- KITRO's numbers
- our numbers
- mesh generation and images with that
