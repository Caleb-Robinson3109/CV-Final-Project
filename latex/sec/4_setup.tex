It seemed to our group that there were three sections of the project that could be worked on concurrently. The first section was the generation of the 3D mesh. Because there was prepossessed datasets, this person could build a 3D mesh visualizer on this data, and later run on the post random forest data.

The second person would be responsible for making the dataset contestable. Because the codebase was new to the team, understanding the given datasets and understanding how to transform it for use would be an important part of the project.

The third person would use scikit-learn to create a random forest model, training it, and testing the model. Any additional scripts would be created as needed.

It was decided that the best way to distribute the files is through GitHub. This is because the KITRO code was already hosted on GitHub and it was most common and streamlined for all of the team members

The last step to get the project started was for all of the team members to read and discuss the KITRO paper. This was crucial to make sure the scope and project where clear, and so that the team had an understanding on what was happening with KITRO under the hood. This would then transition into the teams understating on how to build on top of the KITRO model.
